# Crypto Futures Autonomous Scalping Bot - Master Plan

## 1. STRATEGY FOUNDATION

### Core Philosophy
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine Pradeep Bonde's pullback entries + Qullamaggie's volume breakouts
- **Asset Focus**: BTCUSDT futures (primary), ETHUSDT/SOLUSDT (backup)
- **Timeframe**: 1-5 minute scalping with daily context
- **Execution**: Autonomous algorithmic trading

### Key Innovation Points
- Multi-timeframe volume confirmation
- Dynamic position sizing based on confluence
- Real-time regime detection
- Asymmetric risk allocation

## 2. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

### Initial Setup
- **Starting Capital**: $50 USDT
- **Risk Per Trade**: 0.5% of account ($0.25)
- **Position Sizing**: 10% of account OR 2x concurrent 5% positions
- **Starting Leverage**: 2-3x maximum

### Dynamic Scaling Framework
```
Growth Milestones:
$50 → $60 (20%): Allow 12% positions
$50 → $75 (50%): Allow 15% positions, 5x leverage
$50 → $100 (100%): Allow 20% positions, 8x leverage
$50 → $150 (200%): Full strategy activation, 10x max leverage
```

### Risk Controls
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $1 (2% of account)
- **Weekly Loss Limit**: $2.50 (5% of account)
- **Max Concurrent Positions**: 2
- **Position Timeout**: 30 minutes maximum hold

## 3. ENTRY SIGNAL ARCHITECTURE

### Primary Signal Stack (All Required)
1. **Net Order Flow Surge**: >3x average buying/selling pressure
2. **Volume Confirmation**: >2x 20-period average
3. **Momentum Alignment**: 5min + 1min timeframe confluence
4. **Support/Resistance Break**: Clean breakout with conviction

### Secondary Filters
- **Relative Strength**: Asset outperforming market
- **Pullback Timing**: Enter after micro-consolidation (Bonde method)
- **HTF Pattern**: Daily context shows breakout potential (Qullamaggie method)
- **Regime Confirmation**: Trending vs ranging market detection

### Entry Logic Flow
```
IF (daily_relative_strength > 80th_percentile) 
AND (order_flow_surge > 3x_average)
AND (volume_breakout > 2x_average)
AND (momentum_5min == momentum_1min)
AND (pullback_completed)
→ ENTER POSITION
```

## 4. POSITION MANAGEMENT

### Position Sizing Options
**Option A - Single Position**:
- 10% of account base ($5)
- Apply 2-3x leverage = $10-15 effective

**Option B - Dual Positions**:
- 2x concurrent 5% positions ($2.50 each)
- Different setups: momentum + mean reversion
- Correlation limit: <0.7

### Dynamic Leverage Rules
- **High Confidence Setup**: Increase leverage by 1x
- **Low Volatility Period**: Increase leverage by 1x
- **Recent Loss**: Decrease leverage by 1x
- **Account Drawdown >5%**: Max 2x leverage

## 5. EXIT STRATEGY

### Multi-Layer Take Profit
1. **25% at 1:1 RR** (secure base profit)
2. **25% at 1:2 RR** (standard target)
3. **25% at 1:3 RR** (extended target)
4. **25% trailing stop** (ATR-based)

### Dynamic Trailing Logic
- **Strong Trend**: 2x ATR trailing distance
- **Weakening Momentum**: 1x ATR trailing distance
- **Regime Change**: Immediate exit all positions

### Stop Loss Framework
- **Initial Stop**: Based on 0.5% account risk
- **Breakeven Move**: After 1:1 profit taken
- **Trailing Activation**: After 1:2 profit level

## 6. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

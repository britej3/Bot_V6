#### Do's
- ✅ Use active voice and present tense
- ✅ Be specific and technical when needed
- ✅ Include context for complex changes
- ✅ Reference issue/PR numbers when applicable
- ✅ Categorize changes appropriately
- ✅ Highlight breaking changes prominently

#### Don'ts
- ❌ Use vague language like "improved performance"
- ❌ Include internal implementation details
- ❌ Reference unreleased features
- ❌ Use marketing language
- ❌ Include personal opinions

### Examples of Good Changelog Entries

**Good:**
```
✨ feat: Add real-time market data WebSocket integration
- Implemented persistent WebSocket connections to Binance API
- Added automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Reduced market data latency by 80%
```

**Bad:**
```
✨ Improved market data handling
- Made some changes to how we get data
- Things work better now
```

### Changelog Maintenance
- **Review Frequency**: Weekly review of unreleased changes
- **Release Cadence**: Update with each release
- **Format Consistency**: Use automated tools for formatting
- **Version Accuracy**: Cross-reference with Git tags
- **Accessibility**: Ensure readability by all stakeholders

# Project Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for our project. This site combines traditional phase-based documentation with the modern Di√°taxis framework to provide the best possible user experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Overview

This is a web application built with modern technologies to deliver [brief description of what the project does]. The documentation is organized to serve different user needs and learning stages.

## üìö Documentation Structure

We use a **hybrid approach** that combines the best of both worlds:

### Di√°taxis Framework (User Learning Journey)
The Di√°taxis framework organizes content by user needs:

- **[üìö Tutorials](Documentation/tutorials/)**: Learning-oriented guides for newcomers
- **[üõ†Ô∏è How-to Guides](Documentation/how_to_guides/)**: Problem-focused solutions for specific tasks
- **[üìñ Reference](Documentation/reference/)**: Technical specifications and lookup documentation
- **[üí° Explanation](Documentation/explanation/)**: Understanding-oriented content about design decisions

### Phase-Based Documentation (Development Lifecycle)
Comprehensive documentation organized by development phases:

- **[01 Project Overview](Documentation/01_Project_Overview/)**: Vision, objectives, and project context
- **[02 Requirements](Documentation/02_Requirements/)**: Business and technical requirements
- **[03 Architecture](Documentation/03_Architecture_Design/)**: System design and technical specifications
- **[04 Database](Documentation/04_Database_Schema/)**: Data models and database design
- **[05 API](Documentation/05_API_Documentation/)**: API specifications and documentation
- **[06 Development](Documentation/06_Development_Guides/)**: Setup guides and development processes
- **[07 Testing](Documentation/07_Testing/)**: Testing strategies and procedures
- **[08 Deployment](Documentation/08_Deployment/)**: Deployment and operations
- **[09 Maintenance](Documentation/09_Maintenance/)**: System maintenance and support
- **[10 Standards](Documentation/10_Standards_and_Best_Practices/)**: Coding standards and best practices

## üìñ Documentation Philosophy

### Di√°taxis Principles
We follow the Di√°taxis framework principles:
- **Tutorials**: Learning-oriented, safe environment to build skills
- **How-to Guides**: Problem-oriented, direct solutions to real problems
- **Reference**: Information-oriented, accurate and complete specifications
- **Explanation**: Understanding-oriented, discussion of background and rationale

### Quality Standards
- **Accuracy**: All information is verified and kept current
- **Completeness**: Comprehensive coverage of all aspects
- **Accessibility**: Clear writing for various technical levels
- **Consistency**: Uniform formatting and terminology
- **Maintainability**: Regular reviews and updates

## ü§ù Contributing

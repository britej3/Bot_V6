# Success Metrics & KPIs

To ensure the project is tracking towards its strategic goals, we will measure success using a framework of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). These metrics cover product performance, business growth, and operational stability.

## 1. Product & Performance Metrics

**Objective:** Validate that the core AI engine can deliver consistent, risk-adjusted returns superior to market benchmarks.

*   **KPI 1: Alpha Generation**
    *   **Metric:** Achieve a portfolio return that is at least 15% higher than the benchmark (e.g., a 50/50 BTC/ETH portfolio) over any given 3-month period.
    *   **Target:** Meet this goal within 6 months of live deployment.

*   **KPI 2: Risk-Adjusted Return (Sharpe Ratio)**
    *   **Metric:** Maintain a Sharpe Ratio of greater than 2.0 in live trading. A Sharpe Ratio of >2 is considered very good and indicates high returns relative to risk.
    *   **Target:** Consistently achieve this target after the initial 3-month learning phase.

*   **KPI 3: Maximum Drawdown**
    *   **Metric:** Ensure the maximum drawdown of the portfolio does not exceed 10% over any 6-month period.
    *   **Target:** Enforce this via the AI Risk Management module from day one.

## 2. Business & Growth Metrics

**Objective:** Achieve product-market fit and establish a strong foothold in the target market.

*   **KPI 4: User Adoption (Beta Program)**
    *   **Metric:** Onboard 50 validated "Pro-tail" and "Tech-Savvy" users into our closed Beta program.
    *   **Target:** Achieve this within 3 months of launching the Beta program.

*   **KPI 5: Assets Under Management (AUM)**
    *   **Metric:** Achieve $10 million in Assets Under Management (AUM) on the platform.
    *   **Target:** Reach this milestone within the first 12 months of public launch.

*   **KPI 6: Customer Satisfaction (NPS)**
    *   **Metric:** Achieve a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 50 or higher from our user base.
    *   **Target:** Measure and achieve this by the end of the first 6 months of public launch.

## 3. Technical & Operational Metrics

**Objective:** Ensure the platform is robust, reliable, and secure.

*   **KPI 7: System Uptime**
    *   **Metric:** Maintain 99.9% uptime for all critical services, including data ingestion, trade execution, and the core AI engine.
    *   **Target:** Maintain this standard continuously.

*   **KPI 8: Order Execution Slippage**
    *   **Metric:** Ensure that the average slippage on order execution is less than 0.05%.
    *   **Target:** Monitor and optimize via the Smart Order Routing engine to meet this target.

*   **KPI 9: Model Retraining Frequency**
    *   **Metric:** Successfully deploy updated AI models at least once per week without system downtime.
    *   **Target:** Automate this process to achieve the target frequency within 4 months.

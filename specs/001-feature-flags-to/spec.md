# Feature Specification: Feature flags to gate graph integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-feature-flags-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Feature flags to gate graph integration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to be able to enable or disable the graph database integration at runtime so that I can prevent it from being called in performance-critical code paths (the "hot path") without requiring a full redeployment. This allows for safe testing and performance benchmarking in production environments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the graph integration feature flag is `disabled`, **When** a code path that could use the graph database is executed, **Then** the graph database is not called and the system falls back to a default behavior (e.g., using only Redis or the vector database).
2. **Given** the graph integration feature flag is `enabled`, **When** a code path that could use the graph database is executed, **Then** the graph database is called as expected.
3. **Given** a running application, **When** an administrator changes the feature flag from `enabled` to `disabled`, **Then** subsequent requests no longer call the graph database.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the feature flag configuration is missing or invalid? The system should default to a safe state (e.g., `disabled`) and log a warning.
- How does the system handle flag changes during an in-flight request that has already started interacting with the graph database? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the ongoing request complete, or should it be gracefully terminated? The simplest approach is to let it complete and have the next request use the new flag state.]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a mechanism to enable or disable the graph database integration via a feature flag.
- **FR-002**: The feature flag MUST be configurable at runtime without requiring an application restart.
- **FR-003**: When the feature flag is `disabled`, the `MemoryService` router MUST NOT route any requests to the graph database component.
- **FR-004**: When the feature flag is `disabled`, the system MUST have a defined fallback behavior that does not rely on the graph database.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST log the state of the feature flag at startup.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide a secure way to change the feature flag's value in a running environment. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How will the flag be managed? Environment variable, configuration file, a dedicated feature flag service, or a secure API endpoint?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Feature Flag**: Represents a toggle for a specific feature. Attributes: `name` (e.g., `GRAPH_INTEGRATION_ENABLED`), `value` (e.g., `true`/`false`).

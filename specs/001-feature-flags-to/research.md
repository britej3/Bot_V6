# Research: Runtime Feature Flag Management

## Decision
We will use a simple JSON configuration file (`config/feature_flags.json`) to manage feature flags. The application will monitor this file for changes and reload it at runtime without requiring a restart.

## Rationale
- **Simplicity**: This approach is simple to implement and understand, avoiding the need for external services for this initial implementation.
- **Runtime configurable**: File-based configuration with monitoring allows for runtime changes.
- **Security**: The configuration file can be managed through secure deployment processes and access controls on the server.
- **Performance**: The flags will be loaded into memory, so the performance impact of checking a flag is negligible.

## Alternatives considered
- **Environment Variables**: Simple, but not easily changed at runtime without restarting the application container.
- **Dedicated Feature Flag Service (e.g., LaunchDarkly)**: Powerful and flexible, but adds an external dependency and cost that is not justified for this initial use case.
- **Database**: Storing flags in a database would allow runtime changes, but adds database overhead for a simple configuration need.

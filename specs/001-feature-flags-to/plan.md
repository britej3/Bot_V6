# Implementation Plan: Feature flags to gate graph integration

**Branch**: `001-feature-flags-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-11 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-feature-flags-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This feature will introduce a runtime-configurable feature flag to enable or disable the graph database integration. The primary goal is to prevent calls to the graph database in performance-critical code paths ("hot path") without requiring a full redeployment. The technical approach will involve using a configuration file for the flag, which can be reloaded at runtime. The `MemoryService` will be modified to read this flag and route requests accordingly.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.11
**Primary Dependencies**: fastapi, sqlalchemy, redis, psycopg2-binary
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (for pgvector), Redis, Qdrant (as per PRD)
**Testing**: pytest
**Target Platform**: Linux server
**Project Type**: web
**Performance Goals**: Sub-millisecond lookup for the feature flag status.
**Constraints**: The feature flag check should add negligible overhead to the request path.
**Scale/Scope**: This feature flag mechanism could be extended to other features in the future.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: [1] (api, cli, tests are part of one project)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes, no unnecessary patterns will be introduced.

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? Yes, this will be part of the core infrastructure library.
- Libraries listed: `core-infra`: provides common utilities like feature flagging.
- CLI per library: A CLI for managing feature flags could be added.
- Library docs: Not planned for this feature.

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes
- Frontend logs → backend? N/A
- Error context sufficient? Yes

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? 0.1.0
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context**:
   - How to manage feature flags at runtime in a secure and performant way.
2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Task: "Research best practices for runtime feature flag management in Python/FastAPI applications."
3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`.

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`.
2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements → `/contracts/feature-flags.json`.
3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts.
4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories → `quickstart.md`.
5. **Update agent file incrementally**.

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/feature-flags.json, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
|           |            |                                     |

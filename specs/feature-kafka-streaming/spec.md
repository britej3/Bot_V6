# Feature Specification: Implement Kafka streaming for real-time data

**Feature Branch**: `feature/kafka-streaming`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Implement Kafka streaming for real-time data"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to use Kafka as a real-time message broker for market data and trading signals, so that the system can be scalable, fault-tolerant, and have a clear separation of concerns between data producers and consumers.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a market data feed is producing messages, **When** the data is published to a Kafka topic, **Then** a consumer subscribed to that topic receives the message.
2. **Given** a trading signal is generated, **When** the signal is published to a Kafka topic, **Then** the trading engine, subscribed to that topic, receives the signal.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the Kafka broker is down? The producer should handle the error gracefully, with retries and logging.
- What happens if a consumer is slow? The consumer group should handle the offset management correctly.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST use Kafka for streaming market data.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST use Kafka for streaming trading signals.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST have separate Kafka topics for different data types (e.g., market data, signals).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST have producers that can publish data to Kafka topics.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST have consumers that can subscribe to Kafka topics and process messages.
- **FR-006**: The Kafka integration MUST be configurable (e.g., broker address, topic names).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Kafka Topic**: A named stream of records.
- **Kafka Message**: A record in a Kafka topic, consisting of a key, a value, and a timestamp.

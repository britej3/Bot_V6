- Build foundational knowledge
- Follow a linear learning path
- Include working examples
- Assume little prior knowledge

## Tutorial Guidelines
1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic concepts and build up complexity
2. **Clear Steps**: Provide numbered, sequential steps
3. **Working Examples**: Include complete, runnable code examples
4. **Progression**: Each tutorial should build on the previous one
5. **Success Verification**: Include ways to verify that the tutorial worked

## Target Audience
- New developers joining the project
- Users learning the system
- Anyone who wants to understand the codebase through practical examples

## Tutorial Types to Consider
- Getting started tutorials
- Feature implementation tutorials
- Integration tutorials
- Testing tutorials
- Deployment tutorials

## Template
When creating a new tutorial, use this structure:
1. Introduction and prerequisites
2. Learning objectives
3. Step-by-step instructions
4. Code examples
5. Verification steps
6. Next steps and further reading
7. Troubleshooting common issues

# Reference Documentation

Reference documentation is information-oriented content that provides authoritative, accurate, and complete descriptions of the system's components, APIs, configurations, and data structures. It serves as a lookup resource rather than a learning or problem-solving guide.

## Purpose
- Provide complete, accurate technical information
- Serve as a reliable source of truth
- Enable quick lookup of specific details
- Document APIs, configurations, and schemas
- Be comprehensive and up-to-date

## Reference Guidelines
1. **Complete Coverage**: Document all available options, parameters, and features
2. **Accuracy First**: Ensure all information is correct and current
3. **Structured Format**: Use consistent formatting and organization
4. **Searchable**: Make it easy to find specific information
5. **Version-Specific**: Clearly indicate which version the reference applies to

## Target Audience
- Developers who need specific technical details
- API consumers
- System administrators
- Anyone who needs to look up exact specifications
- Integration partners

## Reference Types to Consider
- API reference documentation
- Configuration reference
- Database schema reference
- Component reference
- Environment variable reference
- Error code reference
- Data model reference
- CLI command reference

## Template
When creating reference documentation, use this structure:
1. Overview and scope
2. Syntax and parameters (for APIs/commands)
3. Examples and use cases
4. Error conditions and responses
5. Related references
6. Version information

## Examples of Reference Documentation
- Complete API endpoint specifications
- Database table schemas and relationships
- Configuration file formats and options
- Environment variables and their effects
- Error codes and their meanings
- Component interfaces and methods
- CLI command options and flags
- Data structure definitions

## Best Practices
- Use consistent terminology
- Provide examples for complex structures
- Include default values where applicable
- Document constraints and limitations
- Keep references concise but complete
- Update references when code changes
- Use clear, technical language

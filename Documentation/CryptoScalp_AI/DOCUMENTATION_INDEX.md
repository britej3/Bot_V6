#### **Professional Architectural Patterns**
```python
# Service Layer Pattern - Enterprise separation
class TradingService:
    def __init__(self, risk_manager, ml_engine, execution_engine):
        # Business logic service layer with clear separation
        pass

# Dependency Injection - Testability and flexibility
class ScalpingStrategyEngine:
    def __init__(self, ml_ensemble=None, feature_engineering=None):
        self.ml_ensemble = ml_ensemble or MLModelEnsemble()
        # Constructor injection enables testing and flexibility
        pass

# Circuit Breaker Pattern - Production fault tolerance
class CircuitBreaker:
    async def call(self, operation, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            raise CircuitBreakerOpen("System protection activated")
        try:
            result = await operation(*args, **kwargs)
            self._record_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._record_failure()
            raise e
```

#### **Advanced Error Handling**
```python
# Exception hierarchy for comprehensive error management
class TradingException(Exception): pass
class ValidationError(TradingException): pass
class RiskViolationError(TradingException): pass
class ExecutionError(TradingException): pass
class CircuitBreakerOpen(TradingException): pass

# Centralized error recovery system
class ErrorRecoveryManager:
    async def handle_exception(self, exception, context):
        # Intelligent error routing and recovery
        # Context-aware recovery strategies
        return await self._route_error_recovery(exception, context)
```

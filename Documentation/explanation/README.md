# Explanation Documentation

Explanation documentation is understanding-oriented content that helps users understand the background, context, and reasoning behind the system. It focuses on why things work the way they do, rather than how to use them.

## Purpose
- Help users understand the underlying concepts
- Explain design decisions and trade-offs
- Provide context for why the system is built this way
- Connect different parts of the system
- Help users make informed decisions

## Explanation Guidelines
1. **Context-Focused**: Provide background and context for decisions
2. **Conceptual**: Focus on concepts rather than procedures
3. **Discussion-Oriented**: Present multiple viewpoints and trade-offs
4. **Big Picture**: Show how parts fit together
5. **Educational**: Help users understand the "why" behind the "what"

## Target Audience
- Developers who want to understand the system deeply
- Architects and technical leaders
- New team members who need context
- Anyone who wants to understand the reasoning behind decisions
- Contributors who need to make informed changes

## Explanation Types to Consider
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- System design explanations
- Technology choice rationales
- Process and workflow explanations
- Domain model explanations
- Security design explanations
- Performance considerations
- Historical context and evolution

## Template
When creating explanation documentation, use this structure:
1. Context and background
2. Problem statement or need
3. Considered options and alternatives
4. Decision and rationale
5. Consequences and implications
6. Related decisions and context
7. Future considerations

## Examples of Explanation Documentation
- "Why we chose this architecture pattern"
- "Evolution of our API design"
- "Security design decisions and trade-offs"
- "Database design rationale"
- "Deployment strategy evolution"
- "Technology stack decisions"
- "Process and workflow explanations"
- "Domain modeling approach"

## Best Practices
- Focus on the "why" rather than the "how"
- Include historical context when relevant
- Discuss trade-offs and alternatives
- Reference related decisions
- Update explanations as the system evolves
- Make it clear when explanations become outdated
- Encourage discussion and feedback
- Link to related explanations and decisions

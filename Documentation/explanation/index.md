## Using Explanation Documentation

### For New Team Members
- Understand why things work the way they do
- Learn about past decisions and their context
- Get insights into system evolution
- Understand team processes and culture

### For Architects and Tech Leads
- Make informed decisions about changes
- Understand trade-offs from past decisions
- Plan future architectural evolution
- Mentor team members effectively

### For Contributors
- Understand the reasoning behind existing code
- Make decisions consistent with system design
- Contribute effectively to discussions
- Propose changes with proper context

## Contributing to Explanations

When adding explanation documentation:
1. **Provide context**: Explain the background and circumstances
2. **Discuss alternatives**: Mention what was considered and why rejected
3. **Document trade-offs**: Be honest about costs and benefits
4. **Include timeline**: When was this decided and is it still relevant?
5. **Link to related docs**: Connect to other explanations and decisions

## Explanation Documentation Standards

Good explanations should:
- **Focus on "why"**: Explain reasoning rather than just "what"
- **Include context**: Provide background information
- **Discuss alternatives**: Show what was considered
- **Be honest**: Include trade-offs and limitations
- **Stay current**: Update when decisions change
- **Be accessible**: Write for a broad technical audience

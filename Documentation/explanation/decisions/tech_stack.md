# Architecture Decision Record: Technology Stack Selection

## Context

In early 2024, we needed to select a technology stack for a new web application that would serve both API endpoints and a modern frontend. The application needed to handle user authentication, data persistence, and provide a responsive user interface. We had the following key requirements:

- **Scalability**: Handle growth from 100 to 10,000+ users
- **Developer Productivity**: Enable rapid development and iteration
- **Maintainability**: Easy to maintain and extend over time
- **Security**: Built-in security features and practices
- **Cost**: Balance between development cost and operational cost
- **Team Skills**: Leverage existing team expertise where possible

## Decision

We selected the following technology stack:

**Backend:**
- **Python with Django**: Web framework with batteries included
- **Django REST Framework**: For API development
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage
- **Celery**: Background task processing

**Frontend:**
- **React**: Component-based UI library
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

**Infrastructure:**
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **AWS/GCP**: Cloud hosting
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code

## Rationale

### Why Python/Django?

**Pros:**
- **Rapid Development**: Django's "batteries included" philosophy allows quick prototyping
- **Security**: Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities (CSRF, XSS, SQL injection)
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem of packages and tools
- **Scalability**: Proven track record with high-traffic sites (Instagram, Pinterest)
- **Team Skills**: Existing Python expertise in the team

**Cons Considered:**
- **Performance**: Not as fast as compiled languages, but sufficient for most web apps
- **Concurrency**: GIL limitations, mitigated by proper architecture

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- **Node.js/Express**: Faster initial setup but less structure and security features
- **Go/Gin**: Better performance but steeper learning curve and less ecosystem maturity
- **Ruby/Rails**: Excellent for rapid development but less adoption in our industry

### Why React/TypeScript?

**Pros:**
- **Component Reusability**: Modular, reusable UI components
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript catches errors at compile time
- **Ecosystem**: Largest ecosystem of libraries and tools
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM and efficient updates
- **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, excellent tooling

**Cons Considered:**
- **Learning Curve**: JSX and component lifecycle concepts
- **Bundle Size**: Can become large without optimization

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- **Vue.js**: Simpler learning curve but smaller ecosystem
- **Svelte**: Innovative but less mature ecosystem
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Too much boilerplate for complex UIs

### Why PostgreSQL?

**Pros:**
- **Data Integrity**: Strong ACID compliance and constraints
- **Advanced Features**: JSONB, full-text search, advanced indexing
- **Scalability**: Handles large datasets well
- **Ecosystem**: Excellent Django integration

**Cons Considered:**
- **Complexity**: More complex than SQLite for simple apps

**Alternatives Rejected:**
- **MySQL**: Less feature-rich and some licensing concerns
- **MongoDB**: Schema flexibility not needed for our structured data

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Faster Development**: Django's admin and built-in features accelerate development
- **Better Security**: Built-in security features reduce vulnerabilities
- **Scalable Architecture**: Chosen technologies scale well together
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Modern, well-supported technologies
- **Ecosystem Benefits**: Rich libraries and community support

### Negative
- **Operational Complexity**: More moving parts to manage (Python, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn React/TypeScript patterns
- **Cost**: Multiple technology stacks increase complexity

### Risks
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Heavy investment in specific technologies
- **Maintenance Burden**: More technologies to keep updated
- **Team Knowledge**: Need expertise across multiple stacks

## Implementation Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Month 1-2)**: Core Django API development
- **Phase 2 (Month 3-4)**: React frontend development
- **Phase 3 (Month 5-6)**: Integration and testing
- **Phase 4 (Month 7+)**: Optimization and scaling

## Monitoring and Metrics

We will track:
- **Development Velocity**: Features delivered per sprint
- **Performance Metrics**: API response times, page load times
- **Security Issues**: Vulnerabilities discovered and resolved
- **Operational Costs**: Infrastructure and maintenance costs
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Through regular feedback surveys

## Future Considerations

This decision will be revisited if:
- Performance requirements exceed Django's capabilities
- Team composition changes significantly
- New technologies emerge that better fit our needs
- Operational costs become prohibitive

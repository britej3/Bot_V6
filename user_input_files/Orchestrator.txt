## ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDATIONS

### Strategic Priorities
1. **Performance First:** Focus on latency optimization before feature expansion
2. **Security Foundation:** Implement security before scaling operations
3. **Infrastructure Investment:** Prioritize managed services for rapid deployment
4. **Team Building:** Hire specialized Rust and ML engineers

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Start Small:** Begin with Python optimization, migrate to Rust incrementally
2. **Managed Services:** Use AWS MSK for Kafka, ElastiCache for Redis
3. **Security Best Practices:** Follow established patterns, conduct thorough audits

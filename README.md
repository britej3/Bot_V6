# Bot_V6 - Autonomous Crypto Trading System

**Project Goal:** To build a fully autonomous, algorithmic crypto futures trading bot.

---

## Current Status: Pre-Alpha (Project Reset as of 2025-09-10)

**This project is currently in a pre-alpha, non-functional state.**

The codebase contains several high-quality but isolated and simulated Python modules for a sophisticated trading system. However, these modules are **not yet integrated** into a working application.

The project is undergoing a strategic reset to focus on creating a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. The immediate priority is to build the end-to-end "plumbing" to connect the existing components into a simple, functional pipeline.

The previous, more aspirational planning documents have been archived in the `Documentation/archive/` directory. The active project plan, focused on the MVP, is now being tracked in `PRD_TASK_BREAKDOWN.md`.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- An environment manager (e.g., `venv`, `conda`)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd Bot_V6
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Roadmap Overview

The project is following an iterative, MVP-focused roadmap.

*   **Phase 1: Foundation & Integration (Current Focus):** Build the end-to-end "plumbing" to create a functional, albeit simulated, trading pipeline.
*   **Phase 2: From Simulation to Reality:** Replace simulated components with real ones and connect to a paper trading account.
*   **Phase 3: Intelligence & Optimization:** Layer in advanced ML models, risk management, and performance optimizations.

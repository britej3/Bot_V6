## **Task Breakdown Guidelines**

### **Task ID Convention:**
- Use hierarchical numbering: Section.Task.Subtask (e.g., 1.1.1, 3.2.1)
- Ensure unique identifiers across the entire document
- Include version numbers for iterative tasks

### **Priority Levels:**
- **Critical**: Must be completed for project success
- **High**: Important for core functionality
- **Medium**: Enhances functionality
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features

### **Status Indicators:**
- **[ ]** Not Started - Task defined but not initiated
- **[~]** In Progress - Actively being worked on
- **[x]** Completed - Task finished and verified
- **[!]** Blocked - Waiting on dependencies or issues
- **[?]** Needs Review - Completed but requires validation

### **Dependencies:**
- List prerequisite tasks by ID
- Include external dependencies (APIs, services, approvals)
- Note any constraints or blockers
- Specify resource requirements

### **Timeline Estimation:**
- Break complex tasks into smaller subtasks (2-5 day increments)
- Include buffer time for unexpected issues (10-20%)
- Consider team capacity and resource constraints
- Account for review and approval cycles

### **Assignment Guidelines:**
- Assign to specific roles, not individuals when possible
- Consider skill requirements and expertise needed
- Balance workload across team members
- Include cross-training opportunities

## **Quality Standards**

### **Documentation Requirements:**
- Use consistent formatting and terminology
- Include comprehensive descriptions for each task
- Provide context for technical decisions
- Document assumptions and constraints

### **Review Process:**
- Include peer review time in estimates
- Plan for multiple review cycles if needed
- Document review feedback and changes
- Maintain change log for significant modifications

### **Change Management:**
- Version control for document updates
- Change log for significant modifications
- Stakeholder approval for major changes
- Risk assessment for scope changes

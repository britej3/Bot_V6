  - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
  - Message deduplication and ordering
  - Circuit breaker patterns
  - Comprehensive monitoring and metrics

#### 3. Database Connection Optimization
- **File**: `src/database/enhanced_pool_manager.py`
- **Features**:
  - Connection pooling with automatic failover
  - Query optimization and monitoring
  - Advanced retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
  - Comprehensive performance metrics
  - Health checks and circuit breaker patterns

#### 4. Comprehensive Monitoring System
- **File**: `src/monitoring/comprehensive_monitoring.py`
- **Features**:
  - Real-time metrics collection from all system components
  - Prometheus integration for metrics exposition
  - Automated alerting with multiple notification channels (Email, Slack, Webhook)
  - Performance tracking and anomaly detection
  - Health checks and system diagnostics

### 🛠️ Enhanced API Endpoints

#### 5. Health Check Endpoints
- **File**: `src/api/routers/health.py`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `/health/liveness` - Basic liveness probe
  - `/health/readiness` - Comprehensive readiness check
  - `/health/metrics` - Prometheus-formatted metrics
  - `/health/status` - Detailed system status
  - `/health/components` - Component-specific status
  - `/health/alerts` - Recent alert events
  - `/health/benchmark` - System performance benchmarks

### 🐳 Production Deployment Pipeline

#### 6. Docker Configuration
- **Files**:
  - `Dockerfile.prod` - Production-optimized Dockerfile
  - `docker-compose.prod.yml` - Production docker-compose configuration

#### 7. Configuration Files
- **Files**:
  - `config/.env.production` - Production environment configuration
  - `config/redis.conf` - Redis optimization settings

#### 8. Deployment Scripts
- **Files**:
  - `scripts/deploy_production.sh` - Automated deployment script
  - `scripts/health_check.sh` - System health verification script
  - `scripts/run_benchmarks.sh` - Performance benchmarking script
